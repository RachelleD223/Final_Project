## Section 1. Introduction

For my project I will Identify what genre of movie was more popular in different years. Like
action romance and comedy say in the years of 2006 2008 and 2010. I would compare what years
were more popular with what genre.

## Section 2. Data Analysis Plan

Were certain genres of movies popular for more than just 1 year overall? does it carry
on for multiple years? whats movie is the most popular within a 10 year time span? were 
some movies popularity influenced by the actors withing the movie or the director of the
movie?

## Section 3. Data

My data set provides movie name, genre, description, director, actors, year run time, ratings, votes, venue, and meta score. My dataset gives its information on these movies throughout a table.
