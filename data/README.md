# Data Description: IMDB popular movies data

I will be using the IMDB.csv for my project for this Final Project.

I use the `IMDB_movies.csv` dataset available at 
<https://github.com/reisanar/datasets/blob/master/IMDB_movies.csv>

This dataset includes information of popular movies on IMDB in the last 10 years. 

The data fields included are: Title, Genre, Description, Director, Actors, Year, Runtime, Rating, Votes, Revenue, Metascore (score of the movie on the metacritic website)

Below I include some basic statistics for this datasets, including range of years and popularity based on rating ...

in 2006 I will see what genre is most popular based on the public ratings (1-10). I will also see if the popularity changes over time based on the year.
